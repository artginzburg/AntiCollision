TypeScript port of collision detection bug by [johnBuffer](https://github.com/johnBuffer).

Original code: https://github.com/johnBuffer/NoCol

## Usage

The following keyboard shortcuts are available

- <kbd>A</kbd> toggle the visibility of the traces.
- <kbd>space</kbd> toggle slow-motion.
- <kbd>esc</kbd> de-focus a followed ball.

Mouse control

- Follow a particular ball by clicking it.
- Zoom into the simulation by scrolling.
- Create new balls by right-clicking.

> View stats by hovering over the top left corner of the screen.

Mobile

- Tap and hold to toggle slow-motion.

## Bonus features

- The ball that has a white dot in the middle is the one that spent the least amount of time being stable (green). So it might be the most interesting one to watch.

## Future features

- Move around by dragging with the mouse
- Figure out how to run the simulation without tieing its speed to the number of frames per second
- Sounds
